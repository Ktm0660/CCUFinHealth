# Implementation Plan & Operating Model

## Phase 1: Discovery & Alignment (0–60 days)
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Form an executive steering committee and working group with representatives from Lending, Retail, IT, Marketing, Compliance, and Community Development.
- **Member & Community Research:** Conduct 20–30 interviews and listening sessions with underserved members, rural partners, and Gen Z prospects. Capture barriers to trust, channel preferences, and success stories.
- **Data & Systems Audit:** Inventory core banking data, CRM, digital banking, LOS, and third-party datasets. Assess consent requirements and data-sharing agreements.
- **Success Metrics:** Finalize the Financial Health Index model, measurement cadence, and baseline benchmarks by segment.
- **Technology Decisions:** Evaluate build vs. buy options (custom development, white-label platforms, fintech partnerships). Issue RFP if needed.

## Phase 2: MVP Build (Months 3–6)
- **Product Backlog:** Prioritize features across assessment, learning, coaching, and resource modules. Define user stories, acceptance criteria, and accessibility requirements.
- **Design Sprints:** Co-create low-fidelity prototypes with members and counselors. Validate language, visuals, and navigation for low digital literacy users.
- **Development Workstreams:**
  - *Assessment Engine:* Questionnaire builder, scoring algorithms, consent management, bilingual support.
  - *Learning Hub:* Content management system, personalization rules, quiz engine, progress tracking.
  - *Counselor Console:* Member profile, note-taking, task management, appointment scheduling integrations.
  - *Resource Navigator:* Database schema, search/filter UI, partner onboarding workflows.
- **Data & Analytics:** Implement secure data pipelines, FHI calculation logic, and Power BI/Tableau dashboards.
- **Compliance & Risk Reviews:** Partner with compliance to test for fair lending, ADA accessibility, and cybersecurity.

## Phase 3: Pilot Launch (Months 7–9)
- **Pilot Cohorts:** Select one rural branch, one urban branch, and one community partner (school or employer). Recruit 200–300 participants.
- **Counselor Enablement:** Deliver certification refresh, platform walkthroughs, and motivational interviewing training. Provide quick-reference guides and escalation paths.
- **Marketing & Outreach:** Launch trust-building campaigns (radio, church bulletins, social media, local events). Offer incentives (savings match, gas cards) for completing assessments.
- **Feedback Loops:** Weekly stand-ups to review member feedback, counselor observations, and analytics. Rapidly iterate UX/content.
- **Success Review:** Compare pilot KPIs to baseline. Document case studies and testimonials for broader rollout.

## Phase 4: Scale & Optimization (Months 10–18)
- **Platform Enhancements:** Mobile app, multilingual content library expansion, gamification, automated nudges, digital wallet integration.
- **Integration with Core Systems:** Automate data sync with digital banking, LOS, and marketing automation for personalized offers.
- **Partnership Expansion:** Add local and national partners (housing counseling agencies, mental health resources, job training programs).
- **Funding & Grants:** Use pilot outcomes to apply for CDFI Fund grants and corporate social responsibility partnerships.
- **Governance:** Establish product council, quarterly roadmap reviews, and member advisory board participation.

## Operating Model
- **Product Owner:** Leads roadmap, manages backlog, coordinates cross-functional teams.
- **Financial Health Coaches:** Certified counselors with digital coaching responsibilities. Metrics tied to member outcomes.
- **Community Liaisons:** Staff or ambassadors who deliver workshops, gather feedback, and onboard members with low digital literacy.
- **Data Analyst:** Maintains dashboards, monitors KPIs, runs cohort analyses, and reports to leadership.
- **Content Strategist:** Curates educational materials, ensures cultural relevance, and updates resource database.

## Member Support & Accessibility

## Data Governance & Privacy

## Risk & Compliance Checklist
